# Clustering
# K-Means Clustering Practical

This practical covers the Kmeans clustering algorithms. The basic idea of clustering is partitioning a dataset into groups with identical or similar features. The classic user case is customer segmentation, where customers are divided into groups of similar characteristics.

In the notebook, I implement the Kmeans clustering algorithm with 2 examples:

* **Customer segmentation**
* **Image segmentation

The data for this practical was obtained from the IBM cloud storage.
